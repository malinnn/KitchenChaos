# Kitchen Chaos

## What is this project about?
This project is a small game developed in Unity, starting with a relatively simple idea that was later modified to meet specific requirements.

## What is the game about, and what is its objective?
The game is a straightforward cooking game. Every few seconds, new orders (recipes) are generated, and players must complete them within a set time. Within the project, the recipe generation rate and the gameplay duration can be adjusted using Unity's `[SerializeField]` attribute, even though these values are private. When the time runs out, the game ends, but players can start a new session, resetting the progress to zero.

## Technical Details

### Menus and User Interfaces
The first screen players encounter is the **Main Menu**, which is simple and includes two buttons: 
- **Play** to start the game 
- **Quit** to close the application.

After pressing **Play**, the game starts. The UI is intuitive, displaying active orders, a countdown timer, and a circular progress indicator.

The **Pause Menu** can be accessed by pressing the `ESC` key. It features three options:
- **Resume** to continue the game
- **Options** to configure settings
- **Main Menu** to return to the start screen.

The **Options Menu** allows players to adjust audio volumes (music and sound effects) and key bindings. A **Cancel** button closes the settings menu.

### Displaying 3D Objects
Unity's built-in **Unity Engine** powers this project. It supports rendering both 2D and 3D objects using its **Rendering Pipeline**. Features utilized include:
- Scenes
- 3D Objects
- Transform Components
- Materials and Shaders
- Camera Settings

### Advanced Transformations
The project implements the following transformations: **translation**, **rotation**, **scaling**, **deformation**, and **mirroring**.  
- **Translation** is evident in the player's movement system and in the items they hold (e.g., food or plates), which move in sync with the player.  
- **Rotation** can be achieved by holding movement keys or by instantly rotating the player 90Â° with the `;` key, using the `transform.Rotate()` method.  
<p align="center"><img width="270" alt="image" src="https://github.com/malinnn/KitchenChaos/assets/116735318/951a6e45-4b27-4f6a-88a9-093601b6e972"></p>

- **Scaling** adds fun to the game: pressing `,` or `.` scales the player up or down using the `transform.localScale` property.  
<p align="center"><img width="287" alt="image" src="https://github.com/malinnn/KitchenChaos/assets/116735318/7058396c-b3bd-44aa-ae5f-68ed06b0546c"></p>

- **Deformation** allows the player to "widen" or "shrink" along the X-axis using `[` and `]`.

- **Mirroring** creates a mirror effect using a plane, custom texture, and an additional camera.

### Shader Programming
Shaders enhance the game's aesthetics through Unity's **Global Volume** settings, allowing for customized visual effects.

### Lighting
Lighting is managed using the **Directional Light** object, which determines how light interacts with the scene.

### Cameras and View
The game uses a camera positioned above the player for a top-down view.

### Interaction
Interactions occur primarily through keyboard input, except in menus where the left mouse button is used. Key bindings are displayed at the start of the game.

### Sound
For music, a **MusicManager** object controls playback and volume adjustment.

</p>

Sound effects (SFX) are managed by a **SoundManager** using event triggers activated during specific interactions.
